# TECHNICAL-ANALYSIS-OF-MID-CAP-STOCKS-USING-CHART-PATTERNS-AND-INDICATORS-FOR-INVESTMENT-INSIGHTS
Technical analysis of mid-cap stocks using chart patterns and technical indicators to generate actionable investment insights. This project involves identifying trends, reversals, and entry/exit signals through data-driven visualization and strategy backtesting.
This project focuses on leveraging technical analysis techniques to study and interpret the price behavior of mid-cap stocks in order to generate investment insights. The goal is to aid traders and investors in identifying high-probability trading opportunities through a systematic approach rooted in data analysis, charting, and statistical validation.

üîç What the Project Does

Flags and Pennants

Triangles (ascending, descending, symmetrical)

Computing technical indicators including:

Moving Averages (SMA, EMA)

Relative Strength Index (RSI)
